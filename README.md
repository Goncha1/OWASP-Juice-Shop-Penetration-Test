#Intern-Intelligence OWASP-Juice-Shop-Penetration-Test

This repository contains the details of the penetration testing I performed on the OWASP Juice Shop application, showcasing various vulnerabilities.

## Objective
The goal was to identify vulnerabilities in the OWASP Juice Shop by simulating real-world attack vectors.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- OWASP Juice Shop
- Kali Linux
- Burp Suite
- TryHackMe
  
Techniques:
-Manual Testing
-Automated Scanning
-Payload Injection

## Vulnerabilities Discovered

 1. SQL Injection
- Payload Used: `' OR 1=1 --`
- Details: This payload was used to bypass authentication on the login page. It works by manipulating the SQL query to always return true:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='' OR 1=1 --

- Result: Gained unauthorized access to the application.

  2. Brute Force Attack

3. Sensitive Data Exposure
Exploit: Discovered sensitive information by accessing a publicly available /ftp/ directory from the "About" page.

Impact: Exposed sensitive files and data due to improper file permissions.

4. DOM XSS
Payload Used: <iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">

Details: Injected this payload into the search bar, triggering a JavaScript alert.

5. Reflected XSS
Payload Used: <iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">

Details: Injected this payload into the URL parameters (id=), triggering JavaScript execution.

Impact: Highlighted the lack of input sanitization in URL parameters.

6. Broken Access Control
Exploit: Inspected the main-es2015.js file and discovered the path /administration. This allowed me to navigate to restricted pages without proper authorization.

Impact: Gained access to admin-only sections.

7. Poison Null Byte Exploit
Payload Used: %2500

Details: Appended %2500 (null byte) to the filename package.json.bak to bypass file upload restrictions.

Impact: Bypassed the file extension checks to upload potentially harmful files.
